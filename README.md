# React Portfolio

## Description
Used React to create a component-based portfolio. I used MaterializeCSS along with vanilla CSS for styling. This Portfolio renders dynamic projects ranging from front-end, back-end and full-stack applications, along with a section about myself. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
