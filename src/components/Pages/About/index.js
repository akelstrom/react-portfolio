      <br />
        In my free time I love to cook and enjoy eating the food I make with friends and family. I love
        listening to all types of music. I currently live in South
          Philadelphia, but my homebase has always been Chicago. I have traveled
          and lived overseas for a good chunk of my life (6 countries before the
          age of 10, listed in the picture below).
